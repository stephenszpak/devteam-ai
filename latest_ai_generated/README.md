# Task Summary

## Task Description
N/A

## Analysis
The task is to create a responsive user profile card component that displays an avatar, name, bio, and contact information. The component should be built using React functional components with hooks, and it should leverage TypeScript for type safety. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, ensuring that the component is visually appealing and responsive. Accessibility best practices should be followed, and error handling must be incorporated to manage potential issues.



## Implementation Plan  
1. **Create a Functional Component**: Define a React functional component for the user profile card.
2. **Define Props Interface**: Create a TypeScript interface to define the expected props for the component (avatar, name, bio, contact info).
3. **Implement JSX Markup**: Structure the JSX to include an image tag for the avatar, and appropriate HTML elements for the name, bio, and contact information.
4. **Style with Tailwind CSS**: Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the card, ensuring it is responsive.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the component is accessible by using semantic HTML and appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.
6. **Error Handling**: Add basic error handling for missing or malformed data.
7. **Comments**: Include comments to explain complex logic and component structure.



## Generated Files
UserProfileCard.tsx, styles.css (if needed), Additional files (if needed)

## Usage Instructions
To integrate the generated code into your React project:
1. Install Tailwind CSS if it's not already set up in your project. You can follow the [official Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
2. Create a new file named `UserProfileCard.tsx` and copy the component code into it.
3. Import and use the `UserProfileCard` component in your desired component or page:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import UserProfileCard from './UserProfileCard';

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <div className="flex justify-center items-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
            <UserProfileCard
                avatarUrl="https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
                name="John Doe"
                bio="Software Developer and Tech Enthusiast"
                contactInfo="john.doe@example.com"
            />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```



## Notes
- Ensure that the avatar URL is valid and accessible to avoid loading issues.
- The component is designed to be responsive, but further customization may be necessary depending on specific design requirements.
- Review and test for accessibility compliance using tools like aXe or Lighthouse.
