# Task Summary

## Task Description
N/A

## Analysis
The task requires creating a React functional component named `LoginForm` that includes two fields: email and password. It should contain a submit button and perform form validation to ensure that inputs are in the correct format. The component will utilize the `useState` hook for managing form state and will be styled using Tailwind CSS. Additionally, it should adhere to accessibility best practices and include proper error handling.



## Implementation Plan  
1. **Create the LoginForm Component**: Create a functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage form inputs and validation errors.
2. **Define Input Fields**: Include controlled input fields for email and password, ensuring they update the state on change.
3. **Form Validation**: Implement validation logic for email and password. The email should follow a basic email format, and the password should have a minimum length.
4. **Handle Form Submission**: Create a function to handle form submission that checks for validation errors before proceeding.
5. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Style the form using Tailwind CSS classes for a modern look.
6. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the form is accessible by using appropriate labels and ARIA attributes.
7. **Error Handling**: Provide feedback for validation errors below the input fields.



## Generated Files
LoginForm.tsx, styles.css, Additional files (if needed)

## Usage Instructions
To use the `LoginForm` component, import it into your desired component or page and provide a function to handle form submissions. Below is an example of how to integrate the component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import LoginForm from './LoginForm';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const handleLogin = (email: string, password: string) => {
    // Handle authentication logic here
    console.log('Email:', email);
    console.log('Password:', password);
  };

  return (
    <div className="h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <LoginForm onSubmit={handleLogin} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```



## Notes
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is set up in your project to apply the styles correctly.
- The email validation regex is basic and might need to be adjusted for more stringent validation based on your requirements.
- This implementation assumes a simple console log for the form submission. In a real application, you would typically handle authentication with an API call.
