# Task Summary

## Task Description
N/A

## Analysis
The task requires creating a reusable modal component in React that can be used for various purposes. It needs to be built using functional components with hooks, styled with Tailwind CSS, and should adhere to accessibility best practices. The modal should also include error handling and be structured in a clean, maintainable manner.



## Implementation Plan  
1. **Create a Modal Component**: This component will take props for its title, content, and a function to handle closing the modal.
2. **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensure the modal is focus-trap-enabled and can be closed with the Escape key.
3. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling the modal.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling to manage possible issues (like missing props).
5. **Export the Modal**: Make the modal exportable for use in other components.
6. **Integration Instructions**: Provide clear instructions on how to use the modal in a project.



## Generated Files
Modal.tsx, styles.css, Additional files (if needed), App.tsx (Example Usage)

## Usage Instructions
1. **Install Tailwind CSS**: Ensure you have Tailwind CSS integrated into your React project. Follow the [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) if you haven't done so.
2. **Create Modal Component**: Save the `Modal.tsx` file in your components directory.
3. **Use the Modal**: Import the `Modal` component and use it in your application as demonstrated in the `App.tsx` example.



## Notes
- Ensure to handle the modal's open/close state in your parent component.
- This modal is designed to be simple and reusable. You can extend its functionality (animations, additional buttons, etc.) based on your application's needs.
