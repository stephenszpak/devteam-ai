# Task Summary

## Task Description
N/A

## Analysis
The task requires creating a simple button component in React that has a red background, white text, and the label "Click Me". The component should be built using modern React practices, including functional components and hooks, while employing TypeScript for type safety. The styling will be handled using Tailwind CSS, and the component should adhere to accessibility best practices. Additionally, it should contain proper error handling and be structured for maintainability.



## Implementation Plan  
1. **Set Up React Component**: Create a functional component named `SimpleButton`.
2. **Add Props**: Define the props the button will accept, ensuring type safety with TypeScript.
3. **Implement Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the button with a red background and white text.
4. **Accessibility**: Add appropriate ARIA attributes and ensure it is keyboard accessible.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling to manage unexpected behaviors.
6. **Comments**: Provide meaningful comments in the code for clarity.



## Generated Files
SimpleButton.tsx, styles.css, Additional files (if needed)

## Usage Instructions
1. **Install Tailwind CSS**: Ensure that Tailwind CSS is installed and set up in your React project. You can follow the official [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
2. **Import the Component**: Use the button component in your application by importing it where needed.
3. **Handle Clicks**: Pass a function to the `onClick` prop to handle button clicks.

Example usage:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import SimpleButton from './SimpleButton';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">
      <SimpleButton onClick={handleButtonClick} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```



## Notes
- Ensure that your project is set up to compile TypeScript files.
- This button component is designed to be reusable. You can easily extend its functionality by adding more props for customization (e.g., `className`, `disabled`, etc.).
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling; make sure your project is configured correctly to utilize it efficiently.
